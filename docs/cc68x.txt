Optimized Code:

-O: Enables full optimization.
Debugging:

-g: Compiles the code for use with a debugger.
Verbose Output:

-v: Provides verbose output showing what the compiler is doing. Using -v -v will show additional version information about the various passes.
Warning Levels:

-W6: To get the pickiest warnings and catch potential issues.
Preprocessing:

-E: Preprocesses to stdout.
-P: Preprocesses but doesn't compile.
Code Generation:

-S: Compiles but doesn't assemble.
Header and Library Paths:

-I<path>: Adds a specified path to the header file search list.
-l<name>: Links with the specified library. Make sure to check the library naming schemes (Unix-style or TOS-style) mentioned in the documentation.
Integer Size:

-mshort: Sets sizeof(int) to 2 (default).
-mlong: Sets sizeof(int) to 4. Be aware that this affects the naming of system libraries.
Code Standards:

-ansi: Compiles in ANSI mode.
-trad: Compiles in K&R mode.
Temporary Files:

-t: Prevents the removal of temporary files.
It's essential to test the chosen flags in your development environment to ensure they produce the desired results and don't introduce unintended side effects. If unsure, starting with flags like -O, -W6, and -g (for debugging) can be beneficial. Adjust the flags as you refine your needs.
